This application automatically scans and analyzes the cover sheets of bachelor and master theses using Optical Character Recognition and extracts the thesis, author and the time it has been handed in.

This software is mainly intended to run on small single board computers which are part of a "submit machine" that accepts the final submit of the theses of students.
